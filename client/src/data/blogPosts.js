    content: `
      <h2>Is Your Website Holding Your Business Back?</h2>
      <p>Your website is often the first impression customers have of your business. In today's digital age, a outdated or poorly functioning website can cost you customers and credibility. Here are five signs it's time for an upgrade.</p>
      
      <h3>1. Your Website Isn't Mobile-Friendly</h3>
      <p>Over 60% of South African internet users browse on mobile devices. If your website doesn't work well on smartphones, you're losing more than half your potential customers. Google also prioritizes mobile-friendly websites in search results.</p>
      <p><strong>Quick test:</strong> Open your website on your phone. Is it easy to navigate? Can you read the text without zooming? If not, it's time for a redesign.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Slow Loading Speed</h3>
      <p>Studies show that 40% of visitors abandon a website that takes more than 3 seconds to load. Slow websites frustrate users and hurt your Google rankings.</p>
      <p><strong>Check your speed:</strong> Use Google's PageSpeed Insights to test your website. Anything below 50 needs immediate attention.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Your Website Looks Outdated</h3>
      <p>Web design trends evolve rapidly. If your website still has:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flash elements</li>
        <li>Cluttered layouts</li>
        <li>Small, hard-to-read fonts</li>
        <li>Stock photos from the 2010s</li>
        <li>No clear call-to-action buttons</li>
      </ul>
      <p>...it's definitely time for a refresh.</p>
      
      <h3>4. Difficult to Update Content</h3>
      <p>If you need to call your developer every time you want to change a phone number or add a new service, your website is costing you time and money. Modern websites with CMS systems let you make updates yourself in minutes.</p>
      
      <h3>5. Poor Search Engine Rankings</h3>
      <p>If customers can't find you on Google, they'll find your competitors instead. Modern SEO requires:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fast loading speeds</li>
        <li>Mobile optimization</li>
        <li>Quality content</li>
        <li>Proper meta tags</li>
        <li>Secure HTTPS connection</li>
      </ul>

    content: `
      <h2>Choosing the Right Technology for Your Website</h2>
      <p>When building a website, one of the most important decisions is choosing the right technology. Two popular options are React (a JavaScript framework) and WordPress (a content management system). Let's break down which is better for different business needs.</p>
      
      <h3>WordPress: The Content King</h3>
      <p>WordPress powers over 40% of all websites on the internet. It's popular for good reasons:</p>
      
      <h4>Pros of WordPress:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Easy to use:</strong> Non-technical users can update content easily</li>
        <li><strong>Thousands of plugins:</strong> Add features without coding</li>
        <li><strong>Lower initial cost:</strong> Many affordable themes available</li>
        <li><strong>Great for blogs:</strong> Built-in blogging functionality</li>
        <li><strong>Large community:</strong> Easy to find developers and support</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Cons of WordPress:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Can be slow without optimization</li>
        <li>Security vulnerabilities if not maintained</li>
        <li>Limited customization without coding</li>
        <li>Plugin conflicts can cause issues</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>React: The Performance Champion</h3>
      <p>React is a JavaScript library used by companies like Facebook, Netflix, and Airbnb. It's ideal for complex, interactive websites.</p>
      
      <h4>Pros of React:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lightning fast:</strong> Single-page applications load instantly</li>
        <li><strong>Highly customizable:</strong> Build exactly what you need</li>
        <li><strong>Better user experience:</strong> Smooth, app-like interactions</li>
        <li><strong>Scalable:</strong> Handles growth well</li>
        <li><strong>Modern and future-proof:</strong> Industry standard technology</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Cons of React:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Higher development cost</li>
        <li>Requires developer for content updates (unless using a headless CMS)</li>
        <li>Steeper learning curve</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Which Should You Choose?</h3>
      
      <h4>Choose WordPress if:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>You have a limited budget</li>
        <li>You need to update content frequently yourself</li>
        <li>You're building a blog or news site</li>
        <li>You need e-commerce with WooCommerce</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Choose React if:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>You need a fast, modern web application</li>
        <li>You want a unique, custom design</li>
        <li>You're building a complex platform</li>
        <li>Performance is critical for your business</li>
      </ul>
